I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Michigan. I am advised by Dr. Shravan 
Veerapaneni and Dr. Alex Gorodetsky. I primarily work on deep learning approaches to problems in quantum computing /
quantum physics and imitation learning.

I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2015, majoring in Mathematics and Economics. Between college and graduate
school, I worked for a few years in quantitative finance.
