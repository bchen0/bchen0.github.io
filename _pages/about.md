I am a postdoctoral appointee at Sandia National Laboratories, in the Optimization and Uncertainty Quantification group. Before that, I received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computing at the University of Michigan in 2024, advised by Dr. Shravan Veerapaneni and Dr. Alex Gorodetsky. I primarily worked on deep learning approaches (in particular generative models) to problems in physics.

I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2015, majoring in Mathematics and Economics. Between my undergraduate and graduate studies, I worked as a quantitative researcher at AQR Capital Management.
