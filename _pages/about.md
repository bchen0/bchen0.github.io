I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Michigan, advised by Dr. Shravan 
Veerapaneni and Dr. Alex Gorodetsky. I primarily work on deep learning approaches (in particular generative models) to problems in quantum computing /
quantum physics. Over the summer and fall of 2022, I interned at Zapata Computing.

I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2015, majoring in Mathematics and Economics. Between college and graduate
school, I worked for three years in quantitative finance at AQR Capital Management.
