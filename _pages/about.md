I am a Ph.D. student in Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computing at the University of Michigan, advised by Dr. Shravan 
Veerapaneni and Dr. Alex Gorodetsky. I primarily work on deep learning approaches (in particular generative models) to problems in physics.

I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2015, majoring in Mathematics and Economics. Between my undergraduate and graduate studies, I worked as a quantitative researcher at AQR Capital Management.
