An identification is found between meta-learning and the problem of determining the ground state of a randomly generated
Hamiltonian drawn from a known ensemble. A model-agnostic meta-learning approach is proposed to solve the associated 
learning problem and a preliminary experimental study of random Max-Cut problems indicates that the resulting Meta 
Variational Monte Carlo accelerates training and improves convergence.
