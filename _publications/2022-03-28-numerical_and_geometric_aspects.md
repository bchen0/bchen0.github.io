This article aims to summarize recent and ongoing efforts 
to simulate continuous-variable quantum systems using 
flow-based variational quantum Monte Carlo techniques, 
focusing for pedagogical purposes on the example of 
bosons in the field amplitude (quadrature) basis. 
Particular emphasis is placed on the variational real- 
and imaginary-time evolution problems, carefully 
reviewing the stochastic estimation of the time-dependent 
variational principles and their relationship with 
information geometry. Some practical instructions are 
provided to guide the implementation of a PyTorch code. 
The review is intended to be accessible to researchers 
interested in machine learning and quantum information 
science.
